# NFL_predictions

Repository for ML project predicting NFL outcomes

Goals:
  - to predict the winner of NFL games using historical data
  - to improve R coding skills
  - to learn about different machine learning algorithms
  - gain experience with data cleaning, feature creation, and feature selection
  
Data:
  - NFL team level data from 19__ to 20__
  - Going to focus on team level data but factor in player injuries
    - Passing statistics at the game level
    - Rushing statistics at the game level
    - Defensive statistics at the team level
    - Betting odds data
    - Schedule
       - Time zone change + start time 
       - Road games in previous week
       - Followed bye week
       - Short week
    - Weather data
        - Indoor/outdoor
        - Temperature
    - Injury data?
    - Eventually work in individual?
 
Methods:
  - Start with one year (2022) for data processing 
  - Add more years once processing code is ready

Processing
  - Team passing and rushing per game
        - calculate rolling average of yards/game
        - calculate rate of change of yards/game
        - run:pass ratio
        -
